# Whatis `dta`

In Spring Boot, a DTO (Data Transfer Object) is a simple Java object used to transfer data between different layers of
an application. DTOs are not strictly necessary, but they are highly recommended in many cases. DTOs encapsulate the
data and provide a clear contract for what data is being transferred between layers.
