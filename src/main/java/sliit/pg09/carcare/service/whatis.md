# Whatis `service`

This `service` package contains service interfaces that encapsulate the business logic of the application. These
interfaces define methods that perform operations related to the application's domain and interact with the repository
layer to retrieve or persist data.

The `impl` subpackage within the service package contains the implementation classes for the service interfaces. These
implementation classes provide the actual logic for the methods defined in the service interfaces. By separating the
interface and its implementation, the application can follow the principles of dependency injection and inversion of
control, making it easier to manage and test the code.
